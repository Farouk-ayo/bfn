              Every success story in the entrepreneurial world can be traced
              back to the vision and dedication of key individuals. Faizah
              Balogun has been a force in planning and implementing the 2024
              programming at the Black Founders Network. Once a participant in
              the Smart Start program herself, Faizah now stands at the helm as
              the Program Coordinator, shaping the future of this year's cohort.
              She founded ‘A Question For’ (AQF), a community platform that
              provides a safe and anonymous space for personal growth, support,
              and storytelling. We talked to Faizah to better understand her
              journey from BFN mentee to Program Coordinator and how she is
              making a difference in the program.

              How Did You Transition From Being A Participant To Becoming a
              Program Coordinator In Under One Year?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>:Last year, I was one of the Smart Start
              participants in the Black Founders Network (BFN) program, and
              after the program ended, I remained an active part of the
              community. I was laid off from my corporate job in January and was
              at a crossroads. Fortunately, what initially felt like a setback
              quickly became a blessing in disguise, giving me the time and
              space to focus on my startup, AQF. However, as time passed, I knew
              I needed more stability, and that’s when an opportunity within BFN
              presented itself.
              <br />
              I was offered a short-term contract as the Program Coordinator by
              Efosa Obano, the founder of BFN. Leaving my part-time job for a
              three-month position with no long-term guarantee was risky, but I
              embraced it wholeheartedly. I was excited about the chance to
              support aspiring entrepreneurs, just as I had been supported
              during my journey.
              <br />
              Stepping into the role felt like a perfect fit for me. I quickly
              realized how much the position aligned with my skills and
              passions. Reflecting on my transition from participant to Program
              Coordinator, it was clear that this was a “no-brainer” for me. I'm
              glad to be a part of how BFN is shaping the future and supporting
              the next generation of founders.
            </p>

          {/* Question 2 */}
          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
              I understand that several programs support Black entrepreneurs in
              Canada. Could you clarify what makes the Black Founders Network's
              support unique?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>: Our commitment to personalized support
              through a needs assessment sets Black Founders Network (BFN)
              apart. Before the program begins, we don’t rely on a fixed
              curriculum. Instead, we start by understanding where each founder
              is in their entrepreneurial journey and their specific challenges.
              This allows us to tailor our resources and workshops to address
              their needs, ensuring that every session is relevant and
              impactful.
              <br />
              Furthermore, BFN’s approach is akin to a slingshot—designed to
              propel founders further by providing the proper support at the
              right time. We also offer non-dilutive funding in various forms,
              such as hiring and Smart Start grants, which are crucial for
              idea-stage founders. This support was instrumental in my journey,
              turning a simple concept into a viable MVP and startup.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
              What are the critical components of BFN's support for both cohorts
              and how do they differ
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>: BFN's support is built around three key
              components: networking, one-on-one mentorship, and group-based
              skill-building sessions. We connect founders within the Black
              community and the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem, offering
              access to events, pitch opportunities, and potential investors to
              help them grow.
              <br />
              One-on-one mentorship comes from our Experts in Residence, who
              provide personalized guidance tailored to each founder’s needs.
              These experts bring practical experience and connections, helping
              founders navigate challenges and develop their businesses and
              personal skills.
              <br />
              Lastly, our group sessions focus on specific skills and topics,
              from storytelling and pitching to wellness and public speaking.
              These workshops equip founders with the tools and knowledge to
              succeed in their entrepreneurial journey.

              How does this year's program differ from last year's and what
              stands out?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>: The most significant difference this
              year is the introduction of the Experts in Residence component.
              Last year, we didn’t have dedicated Entrepreneurs in Residence
              (EIR) for Smart Start Founders, as the focus was primarily on
              helping them formulate their ideas. We've added a dedicated EIR to
              provide personalized, one-on-one support this year.
              <br />
              Another standout is the inclusion of technical talent through our
              Developers in Residence, allowing founders to access the expertise
              they need without searching externally. Overall, this year’s
              program is designed to be more comprehensive, offering founders
              all the resources and connections they need to advance their
              businesses strategically.

              What is BFN's grand vision for its entrepreneurs, and what drives
              these efforts?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>: We envision a world where Black
              entrepreneurs can make a significant impact and are seen as the
              norm rather than the exception. We aim to provide the necessary
              tools and support to overcome systemic barriers, allowing
              entrepreneurs to focus on their ventures without sacrificing their
              livelihoods.
              <br />
              We want future generations of children to consider Black founders
              as role models alongside well-known figures like Steve Jobs or
              Oprah. We also address financial challenges by covering essential
              costs to enable founders to commit to their ventures and drive
              meaningful change.

              Does BFN provide support after the program ends?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>: Absolutely. Once you’re part of the BFN
              community, the support continues indefinitely. Alums remain active
              in group chats, fostering ongoing connections and mentorship.
              Founders can always contact the BFN team and fellow members for
              continued guidance. Events like the startup vest trip strengthen
              bonds and cultivate long-lasting relationships. BFN alums become
              part of a supportive, ever-evolving network that thrives beyond
              the program.

              This year's founder selection for both the Smart Start and

            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Faizah B</strong>: You're right. This year’s founder
              selection showcases various industries, including pharmaceutical,
              health tech, fashion, design, legal tech, HR tech, Edutech, and
              restaurants. The program reflects a broad spectrum of innovation
              and expertise.
              <br />
              For next year’s program, BFN seeks dedicated founders with a
              genuine passion for their ideas. We look for individuals who are
              not only enthusiastic but also committed to overcoming challenges
              and evolving through introspection. For the Smart Start program,
              we value candidates who are deeply invested in solving problems
              and have a clear vision of their entrepreneurial journey. In the
              Accelerate program, we prioritize companies that have demonstrated
              market traction and have a compelling product or service.
              Ultimately, we seek bold thinkers who are open about their journey
              and ready to leverage our support to make a significant impact.
